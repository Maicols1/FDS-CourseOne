### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website (platform) containing an ensemble of software services for the management of code, data, and the collaboration of scientists and developers. 
This means that you can go to [GitHub](https://github.com) to access services (software running on cloud systems) that are meant to help you keep under control 
projects related to software, (small) data, text and figures. 

GitHub uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control (more about version control later). See also note below.

GitHub provides s series of videos and written documentation to help 'on board' new users. 

[Here is the page where you can find the GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en) 

[This is a nice video from GitHub that provides an overview on the many things it is possible to do with GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noZnOSpcjYY).

Using GitHub is primarily free (see their pricing model [here](https://github.com/pricing)). Yet, some of helpful and more advanced features require a paid plan. 
Alternatively, users working for educational organizations (those that have an .edu email account), can request a free GitHub account with additional 
features or receive discounted rates.

Here are resources on how to get a GitHub Educational account if you are a:

* [Student](https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student)
* [Teacher](https://education.github.com/benefits?type=teacher)

Below is a video to get you started with creating a GitHub account using your .edu email. In the next tutorials, we will assume that you have already created an account, or do it together before moving to the next steps.

###### Note about git. Git proposed a revolutionizing approach to software-version control. Git uses a distributed version control system. A dominant version control system preceeding git was Subversion (a.k.a., [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/)). SVN is a centralized version control system. When using SVN a code repository is used by making a copy of the latest version of the repository. That copy is all a user has access to. This means that the entire repository (code and history of code changes) is only stored at the centralized location where the SVN repository was created and is managed. With git everyone who uses a repository and makes a local copy of a repository copies everything (i.e., code and code history). Whereas with a centralized system like SVN only the central-holder of the master-repository has a complete version of the code, with git any user has a complete copy of the repository (text for this note was adapted from [here](https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-when-Git-says-distributed-is-the-new-centralized-and-local-branching-on-the-cheap-next-to-their-logo-on-the-website)).
