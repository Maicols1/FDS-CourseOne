# Make a New Repository on GitHub.

Learning Goals:

* Create and use a repository
* Add files to the repository (without coding)
* Make changes to files
* Push changes to your repository file.

Prerequisites:

* Internet access
* An active GitHub Account

## What is a repository?

A [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) contains all the files and folders innvolved in a software projects. In addition, a repository also contains a properly logged history of all changes that have been made to the code in the files. This history is kep secret, using a parsimonious method that keeps the history small but informative. 

The files inside a repository can be text-files, code, images, spreadsheeets as well as datasets. Yet, git is a suboptimal tool to handling large-binary files, such as large datasets, so in geenral large images and datasets are avoided and not stored inside a GitHub repository. 

Repositories can be owned by a single user, or by an [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) (think about a team of users). 

GitHub repositories can be public or private, that means, only visible to the owner and to any user the owner shares the repository with. 

## Create a repository

#### 1. Navigate to GitHub.com/yourUserID and Sign in to your account.

First, we will use our rpeferred web browser and navigate to GitHub.com. More specifically, we will want to navigate to your GitHub account website. This website is automatically generated by GitHub when you create a user. Your User ID is added after to GitHub.com, so for example my user account on GitHub.com can be found at https://GitHub.com/francopestilli (remember your User ID was defined in [the previous Tutorial](https://github.com/psychdatascience/FDS-CourseOne/blob/main/tutorial002.md)). After navigating to our user account, we will Sign In to GitHub account. That is it! Once logged in your GitHub User Account we will start working with Repositories.

#### 2. Create a repository: Using the Web User Interface (WebUI).

We will next learn how to use the GitHub.com Web User Interface (WebUI) to create an empty git repository. We will not do much with it at first. Yet, we will select the automated create of a ReadMe file and pick a license (MIT 2.0). [This is a nice article on why it is important to add Licenses to GitHub.com Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository). Also ReadMe files have become critical to GitHub repositories. They provide a "landing page" for your project and there are multiple ways to customize them. You can read more about ReadMe Files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).

#### 3. Edit a repository: Add a file to it and then edit the file.

Once a repository is created the next thing we will want to do is to add / remove and edit files. This is indeed why we have created the repository in first place! We will want to use GitHub and get help with content management or code versioning as we develop data analysis skills. Although this might sound confusing at first (we have not yet used the repository), please bare with us for the moment and let's experiment a little bit on how to add and edit the file all via the WebUI.

#### 4. Edit a repository: Edit an existing file.

Now that we have created a repository. Added a ReadMe file, a license and an additional file. Let's practice opening one of the files and editing the content of the files using the Web UI. We will edit the ReadMe.md file, this will give us the opportunity to understand little bit more about MarkDown (or .md files) and have fun with the landing page for the repository. The video below will show you how to edit a ReadMe file using the [MarkDown Syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). MarkDown is a very rich language, but simple at the same time. In our example, we show how to add headings (I called them headers in the video, oh well...) and a list of items.
