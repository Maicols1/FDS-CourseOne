## Using Git and GitHub via the terminal

Learning Goals:

* clone a repository locally on your computer (using Unix/Linux Terminal commands)
* make changes to the repository (adding a file and editing a file)
* make a commit to record the changes
* push the changes upstream, i.e. to repository stored on the cloud on GitHub.com

Prerequisites:

* Internet access
* A linux or Unix based Computer
* The Create a Repo Tutorial via Web User Interface ([Reading 2](https://github.com/PESTILLILAB/learngithub/edit/main/reading2_makeARepo.md))

In this short tutorial we will learn how to perform some of the operations done with GitHub using the Web-UI but using the command line interface on your local computer. To do so, we will need to have Git installed on your comouter. [Here is a guide to installing git.](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

If you are on a Mac OSX the good news is that Git is preinstalled. We will assume that that is the case and ask the others to find a way to install Git on their OS.
