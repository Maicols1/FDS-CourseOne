### File I/O exercise


#### Download exercise data file

For this exercise, you can just download the .csv file into your datasets folder.

Then you can start your own brand-new notebook in your tutorials folder (which should be – needs to be – the parent directory of the datasets folder.

#### Your mission!

Once you've done that, you mission is to

* load the data into a pandas data frame

* make pretty histograms of the two distribution

* make pretty KDE plots of the two distributions

* summarize the data (means, etc.)

* write your data summary out to a new file

* read you summary back in, and visually confirm somehow that the read was successful!

#### Commit and push your work to GitHub
Now that you've done all that work, commit it and push your repo to the cloud where it can bask for all eternity!

#### Submit!
Finally, print out your notebook as a .pdf file and submit it via Canvas!
