### File I/O tutorial

#### Make a new repo and clone it to your computer
For this tutorial, make a new GitHub repo. Name it "PythonTutorials" or "FDSPython" or whatever you want. Then clone the repo onto your local machine. You'll now have a folder with the same name in your local GitHub directory. 

#### Make a datasets subfolder
Inside this folder, make another folder named "datasets". If you named the first folder "PythonTutorials", you should now have a

``.../GitHub/PythonTutorials`` folder and a

``.../GitHub/PythonTutorials/datasets`` folder 

(or similar – the important thing is that your "datasets" folder is a subfolder of wherever you are going to keep your Jupyter notebooks)

##### Note: 
Don't use spaces in your file or folder names for this class (or when using R for that matter). Even though your computer's operating system allows it, it wreaks havoc when you try to read and write files from your own programs.

#### Download the tutorial files
Once you have have a folder, download the .ipynb and the .csv files, and move the .ipynb notebook into the first folder, and the .csv file into the datasets folder. 

#### Push your modified local repo up to the cloud
Now you can push your repo up to GitHub so it's all nice and backed up on the Cloud!

#### Begin the tutorial!
Finally, fire up the jupyter notebook from your terminal (or launch it via Anaconda), open the tutorial, and have at it!
