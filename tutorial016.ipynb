The units can be called at different locations in code to quickly and efficiently perform the oprations implemented in the packaged code. Functions are used to address situations just like the ones described above, where a section of code is used over and over again. Functions accept inputs and return outputs. Functions, contain useful code that performs operations that are likely to be used multiple times. \n",
