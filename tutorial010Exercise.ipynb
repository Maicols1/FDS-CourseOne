Each airplane should generate about 80 dB of noise for 5 minutes, during a 3 hours time period, at a rate of one measurement per minute. Each airplane should contribute noise and the measureemnts of the noise should be noisy too, meaining that each simulated airplane should have some indepednent variation in their noise contribution to the measurement.\n",

Note that to do this, only one number will need to change across planes, all the rest can stay the same. \n",
