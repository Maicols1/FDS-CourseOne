    "Nestor is interested in calculating how much noise he is being exposed to. So he goes and looks up the timetable during the 3 hours window in the morning, when he is at home, and during the 7 hours window in the evening, when he is at hom, and before midnight when the airport shuts down and no more flights land or takeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nestor lives about 2 miles away from the airport. At that distance each jet generates about 75-80 dB (Decibels).\n",
    "We will say 75dB. In the morning there are about 45 airplanes that land/takeoff. Each airplane can be heard consistently for about 7 minutes (we will assume a flat top distribution of the dBs, no ramp up, no decay, a simple flat distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 3 hours window of the morning, Airplanes depart and land every 3 minutes, so their noise overlap for about 4 minutes. The dB of an airplane is corrupted by noise due to the city and nature around around, the cars, trains, trucks (all add some noise, randomly) and the position of the moving cloud in the sky, the wind and humidity (all diminish the noise randomly). So the noise is never 75dB but it stays on average around 75 dB while being corrupted by noise.\n",
